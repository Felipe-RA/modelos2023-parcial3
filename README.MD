This repo contains two notebooks with two different exercises for a test for the Course stated in the title.

Additionally, there is a .csv `usuarios_twitter.csv` to use as resource for it.

For any english speaking person who might stumble upon this repo, there is some **SPANISH** mixed in, specially in the problem definitions.

This is just an academic exercise.
